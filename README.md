# EmotionAnalysis
In this project we have focused our attention on Binary Emotion classification using the EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. The features for the data were extracted through window wise autoregressive coefficients and the features were trained in SVM classifier. Promising results were obtained in the process. 

The description of different files are as follows:

1. DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT MODEL USING DEEP LEARNING NETWORK final [Autosaved].pptx: It contains the project presentation.
2. FINAL_REPORT_1.pdf contains the detailed project report.
3. FinalMatrix.mat: It is the data chosen for classification.
4. blockAR.m: It is the MATLAB function for calculating window wise autoregressive coefficients.
5. main.m: It is the main MATLAB code for SVM classifier.
6. online_ratings: Ratings given by participants to different videos.
